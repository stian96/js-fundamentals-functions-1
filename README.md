# Programming Fundamentals: Functions 1

## Learning Objectives

- Call functions to run the code in them and get the `return` value as a result
- Create functions that take a single parameter
- Create functions that take multiple parameters

## Introduction

In this exercise you will first call some predefined functions and then create your own functions that must `return` a value based on the function requirements and the parameters supplied to the function

## Setup

- Fork this repository and clone your forked version to your machine
- Install dependencies by running the command below while in the project's root directory:

  `npm ci`

## Instructions

- Read through the numbered comments - eg `1. Define a function...` - in the following files to understand the requirements of this exercise.

  - `src/calling-functions.js`
  - `src/creating-functions.js`
  - `src/creating-functions-multiple-args.js` (This is the extension exercise)

- Write your code directly below the numbered comment.

- Add `console.log()`s to get visibility on your solution and run the file with the command `node src/calling-functions.js` _etc_

- See `src/example.js` for some example functions

## Running tests

- To verify your solutions, run the test suite by running the `npx jasmine` command followed by the path to the corresponding test file for each `src/.js` file above, eg:

  `npx jasmine spec/calling-functions.spec.js` (Core criteria)

  `npx jasmine spec/extensions/creating-functions-multiple-args.spec.js` (Extension criteria)

- Alternatively, run:

  `npm test` (Core criteria)

  `npm run test-extension` (Extension criteria)

- To begin with, almost all of the tests will fail - only the example tests will pass with a green `.` You'll see many red `F`s in your console, like the image below:

  ![](./img/test-fail.png)

- Your solution is complete when the all the red `F`s have been replaced with green `.`s in your console, as shown below:

  ![](./img/test-pass.png)
